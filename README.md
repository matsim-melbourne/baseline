# MATSim Melbourne Baseline scenario

This repository contains the baseline scenario for the MATSim Melbourne model. The code in this repository uses the outputs of the [network](https://github.com/matsim-melbourne/network) and [demand](https://github.com/matsim-melbourne/demand) generation algorithms as its inputs.
